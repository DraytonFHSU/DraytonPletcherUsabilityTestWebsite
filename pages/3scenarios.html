    <h1>Scenarios</h1>
    <h3>Katherine Goal:</h3>
    <p>
        Kathrine is a 36 year old mother of one middle school girl. She lives in the rather small town of Sharon Springs (Population 1200). <br><br>
        
        She typically works as an accountant at the local accounting firm from 8 to 5, and she does most of the afternoon cooking around the house as well (Claire eats the school breakfasts and lunchs for mornings).
        This leads her to having some free time in the day, but time that can easily be taken away by helping with homework or calls from friends.
        She has an average technology expertise, but won't go too out of her way to find what she's looking for.<br><br>

        She tries to keep up to date on all of the events that her daughter is going to, 
        but work can get in the way somedays and it can be helpful for her to have access to the website with information on dates and times of events.
        Her daughter has a basketball game this week, and she wants to find the date and time
        for her daughter's game so that she can take time off of work to watch her daughter play. 
        She also doesn't want to make the same food that Claire eats in the morning, 
        so she'll want to double check the lunch menu as well.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Tasks 2-4 (Finding dates for events/items on lunch menu)</p>
    <h3>Holmes Goal:</h3>
    <p>
        Holmes is a 25 year old IT specialist that has been working in the big city for a couple of years.
        After many sleepless nights from the busy noises of the city, he and his fiance had decided to try to move to a smaller town.<br><br>
        
        He's able to work remotely, so location isn't too much of a concern, and he is currently considering a few different towns that may be right for them.<br><br>

        Holmes is double checking through school websites to see what the school is like in Sharon Springs.
        He wants his future kids to feel included and stable in this new possible environment.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Tasks 1 and 5 (First impressions/consistency and quality)</p>
