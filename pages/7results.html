    <h1>Results</h1>
    <h4>Matthew</h4>
    <p>(7:57)Struck by blue color scheme. First impressions say "it's a perfectly servicible website". Mentioned it was missing some bells and whistles.</p>
    <p>(10:25)Was able to find the calendar and lunch menu quickly, but was surprised by the rotated lunch menu and felt not everyone would find that.</p>
    <p>(11:15-21:15)Matthew spent a sizeable amount of time looking for spirit week, but it's so out of the way that he was unable to find it without a couple nudges. Quicklinks was hidden.</p>
    <p>(17:54)Pretty barebones, which makes it easy to find ones way around. </p>
    <p>(18:50)Noted varying picture quality/ picture repetition. </p>

    <h4>Alicia</h4>
    <p>(3:53) Nav should be centered. Pictures again. </p>
    <p>(5:53) Mentioned wanting a search bar. Provided on not distincive enough. </p>
    <p>(6:30)Lunch Menu rotation again. </p>
    <p>(8:10)Main page confusion and picture too big.</p>
    <p>(11:52) Inconsistent quicklink size/quicklink issues.</p>
    <p>(14:40) Daily announcements downloaded to the computer.</p>
    <p>(16:20) Archive issues: Search feature overcomplicated, and months are arranged very strangely.</p>
    <p>(17:10) links take user to top of page every time.</p> 
    <p>(18:25) Search troubles, error message not near search bar.</p> 
    <p>(19:45) Redundant filter in directory. organized by title. Pictures redundant.</p>
    <p>(21:20) Nothing on contact us.</p> 
    <p>(21:40) Dates associated with resources and download issue again.</p>
    <p>(22:40) More out of date articles.</p>
    <p>(22:55) Lack of information on counselor page/redundancy/badly designed counselor page.</p>

    <h4>Illay</h4>
    <p>(5:20) Initial impression is the website is streamlined. Nav looks good.</p>
    <p>(7:50) Issues with the links taking to the top again. Additionally, Illay suggested for a confirm option for changing the date. </p>
    <p>(10:15) Lunch menu issues once more. (11:52) suggested option to choose month of lunch menu.</p>
    <p>(14:40) Start to spirit week.</p>
    <p>(15:22) Changed category. maybe not obvious all are presented as default.</p>
    <p>(19:14) looked in weekly bulletin.</p>
    <p>(20:20) Illay gives up on finding spirit week. </p>
    <p>Consistency good, but (24:20) in depth sections are kind of lacking and overly complicated.</p>
    <p>(27:45) Adding a little bit of differences between tabs could help the website.</p>
    <p>(30:20) Might be cluttered for phone usage.</p>
    <p>(31:55) No autocorrect/couldn't find spirit week in search bar.</p>

    <h4>Other Notes:</h4>
    <p>Multiple options for users on the calendar proved rather useful.</p>
    <p>One incredibly difficult part for the users was the spirit week location. Alicia, who was a part of the student council at her school, quickly found it under the Stuco quicklink.<br>
    Unfortunately, the other two users struggled to find spirit week's location, one giving up at the calendar.</p>
    <p>The poor picture quality stood out to the users and the size tended to make them more annoyed.</p>
