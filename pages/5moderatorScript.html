    Hello! Thank you for joining this usability study. How are you doing today? <br><br>

    Great! Lets see here, I'd offer you refreshments, but this is online, so I can’t quite do that … <br><br>
    
    Before we begin the test, I'm going to ask you some questions. <br><br>
    First off, could I get your name? <br><br>
    
    Next, would it be okay if this is recorded? <br><br>
    
    Roughly how much time do you spend on the internet?<br><br>
    Excellent. Just a few more questions now. Did you do sports in high school?<br><br>
    Do you younger siblings going into sports?<br><br>

    Finally, have you ever been to the Sharon Springs high school?<br><br>
    
    Thank you! I’ve prepared five tasks for you to help guide you. <br><br>
    
    Task 1: Go ahead and go to the website “usd241.org”. What are your first impressions of the front page of the website? Does anything come to mind right away?<br><br>
    
    Task 2: Now let’s do some investigating for some information. Say you were looking to go to  an upcoming Christmas concert. Where and what time would that be?<br><br>
    
    Task 3: What are some of the items on the lunch menu for December 5th?<br><br>
    
    Task 4: Which week is spirit week? (This one’s a little bit rough, so don’t spend too much time looking for it. Probably no longer than 5 minutes. If you don’t find it, just put that)<br><br>
    
    Task 5: How is the consistency on the website? Is it easy finding your footing or do you get lost? <br><br>
    
    Additional Notes:<br><br>
    
    Thank you for  participating in this Usability Study! Hope you have a good day!<br><br>
