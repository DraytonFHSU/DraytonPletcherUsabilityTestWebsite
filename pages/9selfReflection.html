    <h1>Self Reflection</h1>
    <p>I was slightly confused in the beginning of the assignment, as the website turn-in link was hidden under the testing folder. I saw the participation assignment being front and center but missed the website turn-in for a bit.</p>

    <p>I think I started getting a little burnt out near the end.</p>

    <p>One thing I found was that it was kind of stressful for me when I was the overseer rather than then the participant, but ...</p>

    <p>I definitely seemed a lot more comfortable starting the second session though.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I would have like a recommendation or a link to the hosting server we could use so that we don't have to fiddle around with ones that might not work.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thanks for taking a look at my report! Hope you have a great winter break!</p>
